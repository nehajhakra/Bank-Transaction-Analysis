🚀 SQL Bank Transactions Analysis Project 📊
🔍 About the Project
I worked on an SQL-based bank transactions analysis project, where I explored customer spending patterns, high-value transactions, and transaction trends. This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence.

✅ Key Highlights:
✔ Analyzed high-value transactions (above ₹10,000)
✔ Identified top-spending customers & transaction trends
✔ Used Window Functions to calculate rankings & running totals
✔ Created Monthly Transaction Reports for insights
✔ Applied Joins & CTEs for structured analysis

📌 SQL Concepts Used:
🔹 CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for structured queries
🔹 Window Functions like RANK() & SUM() OVER()
🔹 Aggregations like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
🔹 Joins to combine customer & transaction data
🔹 Date Functions for monthly trends
